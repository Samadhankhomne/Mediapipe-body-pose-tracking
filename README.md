# Real-time Body Pose Tracking with MediaPipe

## Project Overview
This project utilizes the MediaPipe BlazePose model for real-time body pose detection and tracking from video input. It captures body landmarks and displays them on the video feed, allowing for visualization of the user's movements and gestures. The solution is implemented using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe libraries.

## Features
- **Real-time Body Pose Tracking**: Tracks key body landmarks and visualizes them on the video feed.
- **Flexible Input**: Supports both webcam and video file input.
- **Adjustable Confidence**: Configurable minimum detection and tracking confidence to optimize performance.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Pose landmarks are drawn on the frame in real-time.
  
## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for the project.
- **OpenCV**: For handling video input and displaying the video feed.
- **MediaPipe**: For pose detection and tracking.
- **NumPy**: For handling image data and processing.
